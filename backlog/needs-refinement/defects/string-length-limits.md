# Database String Length Limits

**Story Points:** 2

## User Story
As a **developer**, I want database fields to have proper length constraints, so that data integrity is maintained and matches validation rules.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Username field limited to 50 characters in database
- [ ] Email field limited to 100 characters in database
- [ ] Role field limited to 20 characters in database
- [ ] Database constraints match Pydantic validation rules

## Technical Notes
- Update User model column definitions with proper String lengths
- Create database migration for length constraints
- Ensure consistency between schema validation and database constraints
- Test with maximum length values
