# Pagination and Filtering Tests

**Story Points:** 3

## User Story
As a **developer**, I want automated tests for pagination and filtering functionality, so that data retrieval features work correctly and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test pagination parameters (page, limit, offset)
- [ ] Test pagination metadata in responses
- [ ] Test filtering by single criteria
- [ ] Test filtering by multiple criteria
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty results, invalid params)
- [ ] Test performance with large datasets
- [ ] Test sorting options

## Technical Notes
- Requires implementation of pagination endpoints first
- Need to add filtering and search capabilities
- Test with various dataset sizes
- Validate pagination links and metadata
- Test SQL injection prevention in filters
- Mock large datasets for performance testing

## Dependencies
- Pagination for users (see pagination-for-users.md)
- Multiple criteria filtering (see multiple-criteria-filtering.md)
- Search functionality (see search-functionality.md)

## Definition of Done
- All pagination scenarios tested
- Filtering logic validated
- Edge cases covered
- Performance benchmarks established
- Tests run in Docker environment
- Documentation updated
