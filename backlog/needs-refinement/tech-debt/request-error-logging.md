# Request and Error Logging

**Story Points:** 5

## User Story
As a **developer**, I want comprehensive logging of API requests and errors, so that I can debug issues and monitor system health.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Log all API requests (method, endpoint, timestamp, IP)
- [ ] Log all errors with stack traces and context
- [ ] Include request ID for tracing
- [ ] Log response times and status codes
- [ ] Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] Structured logging format (JSON)

## Technical Notes
- Add Flask logging middleware
- Configure logging to file and/or console
- Include request context in error logs
- Add request ID generation and tracking
- Test logging configuration and output
- Set up log rotation if needed
