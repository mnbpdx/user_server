# Authentication and Authorization Tests

**Story Points:** 5

## User Story
As a **developer**, I want automated tests for authentication and authorization functionality, so that access control and security features are properly validated.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test user authentication endpoints (login/logout)
- [ ] Test JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Test protected endpoint access with valid tokens
- [ ] Test protected endpoint access with invalid/expired tokens
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Test authorization for different user roles
- [ ] Test token refresh functionality
- [ ] Test security headers and CORS policies

## Technical Notes
- Requires implementation of JWT authentication system first
- Need to add authentication middleware to protect endpoints
- Test both success and failure scenarios for auth
- Validate token expiration and refresh logic
- Test different user roles and permissions
- Mock authentication scenarios for testing

## Dependencies
- JWT authentication setup (see jwt-authentication-setup.md)
- Login/logout endpoints (see login-logout-endpoints.md)
- Role-based permissions (see role-based-permissions.md)

## Definition of Done
- All authentication flows tested
- Authorization rules validated
- Security edge cases covered
- Tests run in Docker environment
- Documentation updated
