# Response Caching

**Story Points:** 5

## User Story
As a **user**, I want frequently requested data to be cached, so that API responses are faster and more efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cache user lists and role-based queries
- [ ] Configurable cache TTL (time-to-live)
- [ ] Cache invalidation when data changes
- [ ] Cache hit/miss metrics
- [ ] Support for Redis or in-memory caching

## Technical Notes
- Implement caching middleware or decorators
- Configure Redis or Flask-Caching
- Add cache keys for different query types
- Handle cache invalidation on data updates
- Test cache performance and invalidation
