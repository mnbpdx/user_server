- [ ] Enable connection recycling
- [ ] Monitor connection pool metrics
- [ ] Handle connection pool exhaustion gracefully

## Technical Notes
- Configure SQLAlchemy engine with pool settings
- Set pool_size, max_overflow, pool_timeout parameters
- Add connection pool monitoring
- Test under high concurrent load
- Document optimal settings for different environments
