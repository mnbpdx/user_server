# API Endpoint Tests

**Story Points:** 3

## User Story
As a **developer**, I want automated tests for all API endpoints, so that API contracts are verified and maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Test all CRUD operations
- [x] Test input validation and error responses
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization *(N/A - no auth implemented)*
- [ ] Test pagination and filtering *(N/A - no pagination implemented)*
- [x] Test response formats and status codes
- [x] Automated test execution

## Technical Notes
- Use requests library or Flask test client (ask user to compare options)
- Create test data fixtures
- Test success and error scenarios
- Validate JSON response structures
- Test HTTP status codes and headers
- Add API contract testing
