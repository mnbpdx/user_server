# User Server

A simple Flask API server for managing users, with SQLAlchemy for database operations and Pydantic for schema validation.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/users/role/{role}` - Get users by role
- `GET /api/users/{id}` - Get user by ID
- `POST /api/users` - Create a new user (ID is auto-generated)
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete a user by ID

## User Creation

When creating a new user via `POST /api/users`, only provide the following fields in the request body:
- `username` (string)
- `email` (string)
- `age` (integer)
- `role` (string)

The `id` field is automatically generated by the server and returned in the response.

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:5003.

## Health Check

A health check endpoint is available at `/health`.

## Running Tests

```bash
docker-compose run test
```
